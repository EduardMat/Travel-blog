          <strong>
            Brasov is the main city of Transylvania, Romania. Being one of the
            most beautiful cities in Romania, Brasov and places around it
            receives the visits of tens of thousand of visitors each year. Sunny
            in the summer or covered in glittering snow during the winter, Brasov
            remains as majestic as ever.

            Right next to Bran Castle, you almost do not feel when leaving Bran
            and enter Moeciu. Totally opposite to Bran, Moeciu is a dream
            village, with large valleys and wonderful hills, the astonishing 
            mountains behind them. You may forget being in a real world,
            this place is really a fairly tale land.
