            you can take a bus, train, or rent a car to reach Brasov.
            <br />
            By train: Brasov has a train station that connects the city to other
            major cities in Romania, such as Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, and Sibiu.
            The trains are usually modern and comfortable, and the scenery along
            the way is breathtaking.
