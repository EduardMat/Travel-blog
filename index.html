          Many people have heard of the historical and legendary region of
          Transylvania but a lot less are familiar with one of the main cities
          of the region, Brașov. This is considered one of the most beautiful
          cities in Romania. It so happens that it’s also my hometown so I might
          be a little bit biased here, forgive me. Still, I want to give you
          just a few reasons to visit Brașov, my lovely hometown.
